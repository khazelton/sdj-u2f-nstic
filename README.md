## Shibboleth IdP Installation

* Following [HowTo Guide](https://github.com/malavolti) from the Italian Identity Federation for installation on sdj-nstic running ubuntu 14.04. Be sure to use the right how-to guide. If you hover over the github filename, it will show the full name. The file you want includes "Ubuntu Linux LTS 14.04" in its name.
* "openSSL >= 1.0.2", buf Ub 14.04 has 1.01f. Good enough?
